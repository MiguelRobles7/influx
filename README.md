# Influx

Welcome to Influx, a buy and sell forum application built with Next.js. This application allows users to create listings, browse and search for items, and communicate with sellers to purchase products.

## Installation

To run Influx locally on your machine, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project's directory:

   ```
   cd influx
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager):

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

After the installation process, you can start the local development server by running the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This command will build and start the application on a local server. Once the server is up and running, you can access Influx by visiting `http://localhost:3000/auth/login` in your web browser to log in to your account. If you haven't registered an account yet, you can do so by visiting `http://localhost:3000/auth/register`. Please note that the application may experience occasional slowness.
